Penguin habitats include oceans and coasts.
They generally live on islands and remote continental regions with few land predators, where their inability to fly is not detrimental to their survival.
They are adapted to living at sea, and some species can spend months at a time at sea.

Diet
The type of food utilized varies with the species, the geographic region, and the time of year.
Most of the smaller southern penguins feed primarily upon krill;
Squid, cuttlefish, and small fish may form substantial fractions of the food, and for a few species, fish is the basic element of the diet.
#####
Physical Characteristics

The tail is short, stiff, and wedge-shaped.
