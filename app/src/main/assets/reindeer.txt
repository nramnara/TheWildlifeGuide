Habitat
They are found in the Arctic tundra (a cold treeless plain, frequently poorly drained)
and adjacent boreal forests of Greenland, Scandinavia, Russia, Alaska, and Canada.
#####
Diet
Their summer food is grass, sedges, green leaves of shrubs and new growth of larch, willow, and birch; mushrooms are sought in late summer.
In winter, metabolism slows, and reindeer rely on high-carbohydrate lichens called reindeer moss, which they reach by digging craters in the snow.
#####
Physical Characteristics
Reindeer have deeply cloven hoofs so the feet can spread on snow or soft ground; they are also good swimmers.
Colour varies from whitish in winter to brown in summer.
Antlers with up to 44 points can grow to 1.4 metres long in males; this is the only deer species in which females also have antlers.
#####
Known For
Reindeer are known around the world as the fictional sidekicks of Santa Claus.
