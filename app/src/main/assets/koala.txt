Habitat
They live over a range of open forest and woodland communities, especially where eucalyptus trees are, because they depend on that select group of trees for food. 
They are found in larger numbers in areas with more fertile soil and along watercourses. 
#####
Diet
Koalas are herbivores and very selective feeders, only eating leaves of certain eucalyptus trees.
Rarely, they might eat leaves from related tree species like lophostemon and corymbia species (paperbark and bloodwood trees).

Physical Characteristics
The koala is virtually tailless, with a stout and gray body and a pale yellow or cream-coloured.
The broad face has a wide, rounded, leathery nose, small yellow eyes, and big fluffy ears, with strong and flawed feet.

Known For
Well-known for their furry ears and big black nose, the koala's diet leaves it with little energy, so the animal spends long hours sleeping in trees.
