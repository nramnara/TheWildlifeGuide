Most burrow into the soft substrate to varying depths, while some groups live free on the sea floor.
#####

Clams eat plankton, algae, and other organic matter that passes through their filtration system.

Physical Characteristics

A clam's shell consists of two (usually equal) valves, which are connected by a hinge joint and a ligament that can be external or internal.
